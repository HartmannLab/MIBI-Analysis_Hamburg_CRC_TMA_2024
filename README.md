# MIBI Analysis â€“ Hamburg CRC TMA 2024

This repository compiles the scripts used to process and analyze the data for the spatial metabolic protein atlas of colorectal cancers.

## Study authors

Teresa Glauner, Loan Vulliard, Felix Hartmann and friends.

## Data availability

Data will be made available at a later point.

## Analysis workflow

Metadata preparation (`notebooks/metadata`)  

Preprocessing (`notebooks/preprocessing`):

* Image extraction and channel compensation with Toffy
* Gradient correction
* CLAHE correction of segmentationg channels, image segmentation with CellPose and feature extraction
* Cell and mask filtering
* Data transformation

Quality control (`notebooks/qc`)  

Visualization (`notebooks/viz`)  

Cell type annotation (`notebooks/lineage`)  

* Major lineage marker annotation (`Annotation_gating_Hamburg`)
* Curation and agreement with PyFlowSOM (`Pyflowsome_clustering_Hamburg`)
* Scyan clustering (`annotation_scyan`)
* Consensus lineage annotations (`annotation_consensus`)
* Analysis and visualization of cell type abundance (`CellTypeViz`)

## Code overview

Jupyter notebooks can be found in the `notebooks` folder.

## Environment

Please note that the analyses steps have been run in different environments and reproducing the entire workflow would require to adapt paths and requirements. Most scripts can be run using the [koalive/mibiprofiling](https://hub.docker.com/r/koalive/mibiprofiling/tags) Docker image.
